# SonarTracking
  
SonarTracking is just a working title for now.  
Experimenting with Ultrasonic sensors for underwater usage.  
Maybe we will add more sensors on the way.  
  
This project is just a way for me to learn my ways around microcontrollers and such things.  

### Tests
Example Pulse outoput:  

<img src="resources/images/PULSE_DRAFT_1.jpeg" alt="PULSE_DRAFT" width="1000"/>
  
First valid check roughly 9 meters.  
The echo sounder we had on board showed similar values for this depth.  
After roughly 10-12 meters it started to get unprecise and at a depth of 18 meters or more it stopped reliably working in the first test.  
The video just shows the setup used on the boat.
